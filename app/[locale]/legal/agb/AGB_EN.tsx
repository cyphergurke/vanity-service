      <p className="text-lg">§1 Validity towards entrepreneurs or consumers and
        definitions of terms
      </p>
      <p>(1) The following General Terms and Conditions apply to all deliveries between us
        and a consumer or entrepreneur in the version valid at the time of the order.
        <br />
        <br />A consumer is any natural person who enters into a legal transaction for purposes that
        are predominantly neither commercial nor their independent professional activity (§ 13 BGB).
      </p>
      <p>According to this, an entrepreneur is any natural or legal person or partnership
        with legal capacity who, when concluding a legal transaction, acts in the exercise of their
        commercial or independent professional activity.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>§2 Conclusion of a contract, storage of the contract text
      </p>
      <p>(1) The following regulations concerning the conclusion of the contract apply to
        orders via our internet store https://vanity-address.bitcoin-uni.de .
      </p>
      <p>(2) In the event of the conclusion of the contract, the contract is concluded with
      </p>
      <p>
        {process.env.COMPANY_NAME}
        {process.env.PHONE_NUMBER}
        {process.env.UST_NR}
      </p>
      <p>
        {process.env.OWNER_NAME}

      </p>
      <p>
        {process.env.ADDR_ZIP_AND_CITY}
      </p>
      <p>(3) The presentation of the services does not represent a legally binding
        contractual offer on our part, but is only a non-binding invitation to the consumer to order
        services. With the order of the desired commodity the consumer delivers an offer binding for
        him on conclusion of a sales contract.
      </p>
      <p>(4) Upon receipt of an order in our internet store, the following regulations apply:
        The consumer submits a binding offer to conclude a contract by successfully completing the
        ordering procedure provided in our Internet store.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />The order is placed in the following steps:
        <br />1) Selection of the desired Bitcoin address
        <br />2) Confirm the selection by clicking the "Order" buttons
        <br />3) Upon payment, the calculation of the address will be started.
        <br />4) As soon as the desired Bitcoin address is found the order will be sent by email!
      </p>
      <p>Prior to the binding dispatch of the order, the consumer can return to the Internet
        site where the customer's details are recorded and input errors are corrected or the
        ordering process is aborted by closing the Internet browser by pressing the "Back" button
        contained in the Internet browser used by the consumer after checking his details. We will
        immediately confirm receipt of the order by means of an automatically generated e-mail
        ("order confirmation"). With this we accept your offer.
      </p>
      <p>(5) Storage of the contract text for orders placed via our Internet store : We will
        send you the order data and our General Terms and Conditions by e-mail. You can also view
        the AGB at any time at https://vanity-address.bitcoin-uni.de/sites/agb.html. Your order data
        are for security reasons no longer accessible via the Internet.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>§2.5 Subject of the contract
      </p>
      <p>Wallet
        <br />What is a wallet? A wallet is an app and works like a digital wallet. The customer uses
        it to manage BTC on his smartphone.
      </p>
      <p>Using a secure wallet. Bitcoin Uni has no influence on the selection of the
        customer's wallet. Bitcoin Uni recommends the Customer to use a Wallet with up-to-date
        encryption.
      </p>
      <p>Securing own BTC. Bitcoin Uni recommends the Customer not to rely on the use of a
        single wallet software but to regularly make backup copies of the BTC on different storage
        locations and to encrypt these, especially in the case of backup copies stored online.
      </p>
      <p><br />§3 Prices, Shipping Costs, Payment, Due Date
      </p>
      <p>(1) The prices quoted do not include statutory value added tax or other price
        components.
      </p>
      <p>(2) The consumer has the possibility of payment via PayPal, Bitcoin and Litecoin.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>§4 Delivery
        <br />(1) Unless we have clearly stated otherwise in the product description, all items
        offered by us are ready for immediate shipment. The delivery takes place here at the latest
        within 7 working days. Except in case of impossibility or other legally valid circumstances.
        In this case, the period for delivery in case of payment in advance begins on the day after
        the payment order to the bank instructed with the transfer and for all other payment methods
        on the day after the conclusion of the contract. If the end of the period falls on a
        Saturday, Sunday or public holiday at the place of delivery, the period shall end on the
        next working day.
      </p>
      <p>(2) The risk of accidental loss and accidental deterioration of the goods sold shall
        not pass to the Buyer until the goods are handed over to the Buyer, even in the case of mail
        order purchases.
      </p>
      <p>§5 Reservation of title
        <br />We reserve the right of ownership of the goods until the purchase price has been paid in
        full.
      </p>
      <p>There is no right of revocation for Vanity addresses, since the customer* cannot
        return the goods, since they are also no longer of value or use, the exclusion regulation
        according to § 312g paragraph 2 BGB applies.
      </p>
      <p>If your order has not yet been fully invoiced, you can cancel the order, whereby a
        fee may be charged for the duration of the invoicing.
      </p>
      <p>§5.5 Intellectual Property
        <br />Our services, rights, claims, or the like are protected by copyright and commercial or
        corporate law where Bitcoin Uni benefits. Otherwise, the applicable law applies, if possible
        German law. Except as explicitly and individually permitted, Bitcoin Uni reserves all
        exclusive rights, titles, interests and the like. This includes all copyrights,
        international or national property rights and all associated rights.
      </p>
      <p>No one may remove, alter, obscure or distribute any of these rights. In particular,
        copyright, trademark, service mark, or any other copyright, proprietary or intellectual
        property rights. This includes any right attributed or conferred by Bitcoin Uni to
        technical, written, owned or created content.

      </p>
      <p>§6 - Disclaimer of Liability
      </p>
      <p>Gross negligence
      </p>
      <p> Liability of Bitcoin Uni is excluded unless the damage incurred was caused
        intentionally or through gross negligence by Bitcoin Uni or a third party attributable to
        it.
      </p>
      <p>No liability for data loss
      </p>
      <p> Liability for loss of data that Bitcoin Uni could not have prevented is excluded.
        This includes damages caused by unforeseeable events, in particular network disturbances,
        computer failures or criminal activities by third parties.
      </p>
      <p>Liability limit
      </p>
      <p> The liability of Bitcoin Uni is limited to the amount of the individual contract
        value, i.e. to the purchase price in Euro agreed in each case in the context of a purchase
        contract.
      </p>
      <p>No liability for loss of profit
      </p>
      <p> Bitcoin Uni does not warrant that the services offered through the Website will
        meet the requirements of the customers, be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free. In
        particular, Bitcoin Uni assumes no liability in the event of technical malfunctions of the
        website and it was therefore not possible for the Customer to purchase the vanity address
        from Bitcoin Uni at the desired purchase price. Liability for loss of profit is excluded.
      </p>
      <p>No liability for third parties
      </p>
      <p>By entering into any legal transaction with Bitcoin Uni or using this website or any
        related services, the contracting party agrees to waive all rights against or possible
        responsibilities of Bitcoin Uni that may arise from the use of devices or similar other, or
        "Third-Party Applications" against Bitcoin Uni.
      </p>
      <p>By using the Site, you expressly relieve and release Bitcoin Uni from any and all
        liability arising from your use of any Third-party Applications.
      </p>
      <p>§7 - No right of withdrawal
      </p>
      <p>No right of withdrawal. Bitcoin is subject to general price fluctuations and its
        later value after conclusion of the purchase contract may differ substantially from the
        purchase price paid. Bitcoin Uni has no influence whatsoever on these price fluctuations.
        For this reason, there is no possibility under the provisions of the FAGG to withdraw from
        the purchase contract for the Bitcoins sold (no right of withdrawal).
      </p>
      <p>§8 Taxes / Taxes
        <br />It is not the responsibility of Bitcoin Uni to determine what, or if any, taxes are
        payable on any services or similar Bitcoin Uni products purchased by the contracting party
        (consumer or business) under this Agreement. It is the responsibility of the contracting
        party not to determine with Bitcoin Uni whether taxes on the Wallet or transactions,
        credits, air drops or speculative items stored there fall due.
      </p>
      <p>It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply due to your use of
        Bitcoin Uni Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to
        the appropriate tax authority. Blockchain.com is not responsible for determining whether
        taxes apply to your Virtual Currency transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding
        or remitting any taxes arising from any virtual currency transactions.

        contract as a whole shall remain unaffected. The invalid or unenforceable provision shall be
        replaced by a valid and enforceable provision whose effects come as close as possible to the
        economic objective which the parties to the contract had pursued with the invalid or
        unenforceable provision. The above provisions shall apply accordingly in the event that the
        contract proves to be incomplete.
