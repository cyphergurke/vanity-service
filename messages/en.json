    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "q1": {
      "title": "What is a Bitcoin Vanity Address?",
      "text": "Vanity addresses are personalized Bitcoin addresses. \n Since Bitcoin addresses are very cryptic, personalized addresses can be helpful in identifying the recipient. \n \n Personalized addresses are just as secure as regular addresses. In terms of privacy, they behave like normal addresses. Anyone can create a vanity address with 1Love... and transactions can be transmitted via Tor for privacy protection, or a transaction mixer can be used to make the transaction untraceable! \n \n On the other hand, vanity addresses can provide more security to identify the recipient precisely, as the longer the defined character string, the more expensive it is for an attacker to find a vanity address longer than the owner's. \n \n Example: The address 1Bitcoin21... contains 9 defined characters. Finding this with a conventional computer would take several years. The address generator, however, will only need a few days due to dedicated hardware and smart software. \n \n Typically, two or three additional characters are also remembered, which randomly follow the prefix, such as 1Bitcoin21tv5..., so the attacker must account for these as well. However, with each additional character, the difficulty and calculation time increase by a factor of 58. During the attacker's lifetime, it will be impossible to find an address with 11 or 12 characters, as it would cost millions in hardware and electricity! \n \n Vanity addresses can even be used to write messages to the blockchain by receiving amounts from several vanity addresses in succession, which is visible in the blockchain explorer!"
    },
    "q2": {
      "title": "How long does it take to find a Vanity Address?",
      "text": "The calculation time depends on several factors. Firstly, the length of the character string is crucial, and secondly, whether case sensitivity is considered. \n \n In general, it is impossible to say exactly how long a calculation will take, as the process is based on randomness! \n \n Each additional character increases the difficulty and therefore the duration by a factor of 58 to find a vanity address with the desired prefix. \n \n Currently, this generator takes between a few seconds and 25 minutes to find a vanity address with 6 characters. This will change once the hardware is upgraded, and addresses up to 9 characters will be found within a few days. \n \n If case sensitivity is ignored, addresses with 10 characters could be found within a few hours or a few days."
    },
    "q3": {
      "title": "How are Vanity Addresses generated securely and trustlessly?",
      "text": "With the split-key method, customers retain possession of their private keys. The split-key method guarantees that vanity addresses are as secure as any other address. \n \n To securely merge the partial keys, use the Key Merging tool in a private tab in incognito mode, and turn your computer or smartphone offline. This way, you can safely merge the keys! \n \n In Brave Browser's incognito mode, no data can be stored in the background. When offline, no one can steal your private key! \n \n Before going back online with your device, ensure that the final private key of the vanity address is imported into a wallet or stored as cold storage. Also, make sure that the private key is no longer in your clipboard after copying."
    },
    "q4": {
      "title": "How is the price determined?",
      "text": "The price of the addresses is determined by the cost of the expensive hardware, which requires a significant amount of electricity, and the previous investments in the sophisticated backend of the vanity address generator. \n \n Compared to other providers, the most efficient software and hardware are used, with a guarantee of 100% renewable energy. The B-Uni vanity address service is many times cheaper and safer than other services. \n \n Additionally, further developments will be funded, such as an open-source software project for DIY hardware wallets that support vanity addresses and key merging! \n \n More cryptocurrencies will be added to the address generator, and the community will decide which ones they will be! \n \n Lastly, proceeds will benefit a good cause. Payments will be automatically donated to charitable organizations, which will be publicly visible to customers thanks to the blockchain! This is planned for 2021/22!"
    },
    "q5": {
      "title": "Where can I get the public key (WIF compressed)?",
      "text": "You get the public key from your private key. The generator only accepts compressed public keys. Generate a compressed private WIF key and store it securely like any other private key; a wallet can derive the public key from the private key. \n \n Example with the Electrum Wallet:  \n Use an existing wallet or create a new wallet with a seed and a strong password. Backup the seed and wallet.dat! \n \n Ensure your device is offline! \n \n Retrieve the private key: \n Click on \"View\" -> \"Show Addresses\" -> Click the \"Addresses\" button in the header, select one of the addresses, and label it, e.g., \"key for vanityaddr\" -> Right-click on this labeled address and select \"private key\"; by entering the password, the private key will be shown, which starts with \"L\" or \"K\". \n \n You can display it as a QR code to import this private key into your preferred mobile wallet. You will need this private key later for key merging. \n \n Retrieve the public key: \n Right-click again on this labeled address and select \"Details,\" the public key (WIF-compressed) will be displayed. Copy the public key or scan it as a QR code and save it in a note!"
    },
    "q6": {
      "title": "How to import the Vanity Address / final private key into a wallet?",
      "text": "In general, any wallet that has an import function for WIF-compressed (Wallet Import Format) keys can be used. \n It may be that your chosen wallet does not show the vanity address but another address format of this private key! \n \n Import the final private key into the Electrum wallet: \n Open Electrum, click on \"Wallet\" -> \"Private Key\" -> \"Import\" \n To import a specific address type (from the final key), write the following before the final key: \n p2pkh:KxZcY47uGp9a... -> 1BTCgQM... \n p2wpkh-p2sh:LxZcY47uGp9a... -> 3MiauXF... \n p2wpkh:KxZcY47uGp9a... -> bc1qcryptqueen3fjfk... \n \n \n \n For Android, I recommend the Mycelium or Bluewallet app. \n \n In the Mycelium wallet, go to the account overview and click on the key symbol with the plus sign at the top right. On the next page, you can import the final key from a QR code or from the cache. \n Navigate to the account of the imported final private key, tap on the address's QR code to switch between the three formats P2SH, legacy & bech32. \n \n Bluewallet displays the legacy address by default when importing the WIF key, but if there is money on the p2sh or bech32 address, it will display the corresponding address. \n \n Open Bluewallet, tap the plus sign in the top right corner, tap \"import wallet,\" paste the final private key, and press \"import\"."
